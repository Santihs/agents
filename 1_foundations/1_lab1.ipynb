       "\n",
       "**Core Problem Solved:**\n",
       "The introduction of new Java features, especially those in preview like \"Unnamed Classes and Instance Main Methods,\" brings exciting possibilities but also adds friction for developers wanting to experiment. Setting up specific JDK versions, remembering command-line flags (`--enable-preview --source 25`), and managing project boilerplate for simple tests can be a barrier for beginners, experimenters, and competitive programmers.\n",
       "\n",
       "**The \"Modern Java Sandbox\" aims to remove this friction.**\n",
       "\n",
       "**Business Concept:**\n",
       "An online, cloud-based interactive development environment (IDE) and code playground specifically designed for rapidly experimenting with and learning **modern Java features**, including upcoming and preview functionalities from Java 21, 25, and beyond. It provides an intuitive interface to write, compile, and run Java code instantly, abstracting away the setup complexity.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Target Audience:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Beginners:** Those just starting with Java can use the \"minimal\" `void main()` syntax without worrying about `public static void main(String[] args)` or class declarations, making their first \"Hello, World!\" experience extremely straightforward.\n",
       "2.  **Experienced Developers:** Professionals looking to quickly try out new language features (like unnamed classes, virtual threads, pattern matching, records, etc.) without local JDK installations or project setup.\n",
       "3.  **Educators & Students:** Teachers can use it for live coding demonstrations, and students can practice without environmental setup issues.\n",
       "4.  **Competitive Programmers:** A fast, no-setup environment for quick problem-solving and algorithm testing.\n",
       "5.  **Technical Interviewers/Interviewees:** For live coding assessments, allowing focus on logic rather than setup.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Key Features (Leveraging the \"Hello, World!\" example):**\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Multi-Version Java Support:** Allow users to easily select and switch between various Java versions (e.g., Java 8, 11, 17, 21, 25, and the very latest preview builds).\n",
       "2.  **Automated Preview Feature Toggling:** A simple checkbox or dropdown to \"Enable Preview Features\" for the selected Java version. This automatically applies the necessary `javac --enable-preview --source <version>` and `java --enable-preview` flags behind the scenes, exactly as described in the prompt.\n",
       "3.  **Boilerplate-Reduced Templates:**\n",
       "    *   **\"Hello, World!\" Templates:** Provide one-click templates for both the \"Traditional\" (`public class HelloWorld {...}`) and \"Minimal\" (`void main() {...}`) \"Hello, World!\" examples, clearly showcasing the difference.\n",
       "    *   **New Feature Templates:** Pre-configured snippets to demonstrate other modern Java features (e.g., Records, Sealed Classes, Pattern Matching, Virtual Threads) that require specific Java versions or preview flags.\n",
       "4.  **Instant Compilation & Execution:** Fast, cloud-based compilation and execution of Java code with real-time output display in the browser.\n",
       "5.  **Code Sharing & Embedding:** Users can save their code, generate unique shareable URLs, and easily embed their code snippets (with live execution capabilities) onto blogs, tutorials, or documentation.\n",
       "6.  **Basic IDE Functionality:** Syntax highlighting, basic auto-completion (for common library calls like `System.out.println`), and clear error messages.\n",
       "7.  **Dependency Management (Advanced Tier):** For more complex examples, allow users to include common Maven/Gradle dependencies to test features with popular libraries (e.g., JUnit, Spring Boot snippets).\n",
       "8.  **Interactive Tutorials & Challenges:** Guided paths demonstrating how to use new Java features effectively, starting with the very basics like the minimal `void main()`.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Monetization Model:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Freemium:** Basic usage (limited execution time/storage, public code only, standard features) is free to attract a large user base.\n",
       "*   **Subscription Tiers (e.g., \"Pro\", \"Team\", \"Enterprise\"):**\n",
       "    *   **Pro Tier:** Unlimited execution, private code storage, faster/more powerful compute resources, advanced IDE features, custom JDK configurations.\n",
       "    *   **Team/Edu Tier:** Collaboration features, organization accounts, dedicated resources for educational institutions or corporate training.\n",
       "*   **API Access:** Offer an API for other platforms (LMS, blogs, documentation sites) to embed and run Java code snippets seamlessly within their own content.\n",
       "*   **Sponsorships/Ads:** Potentially non-intrusive ads on the free tier, or sponsored content/integration from Java tool vendors.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Why this idea leverages the prompt:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Directly addresses the \"How to Compile and Run\" friction:** The detailed instructions with `--enable-preview` are complex for beginners; this platform automates it.\n",
       "*   **Highlights the \"Why this feature?\" of Unnamed Classes:** It makes Java more accessible for beginners and simplifies scripting, which this platform embraces.\n",
       "*   **Showcases the \"When to use it\" vs. \"When to stick to traditional\":** The platform would visually demonstrate both, helping users understand the trade-offs.\n",
       "*   **Future-Proofing:** Positioned as a platform for Java 25 and *upcoming* features, it caters to developers who want to stay at the cutting edge.\n",
